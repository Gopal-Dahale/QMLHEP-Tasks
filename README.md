# Tasks for Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for High Energy Physics Analysis at the LHC

The project description can be found [here](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/2022/proposal_QMLHEP2.html) and the corresponding tasks are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vSeQWHXbf-87eCPcEj-LcYEcBpPKnqCYoU0uf7PH-ou_XRdcg_xtXaP4fzSY8b_FiGMIyqsLjDNWqZD/pub)

File names are self sufficient to identify the tasks. Below are the clickable file links for each task.

1. [Task I: Quantum Computing Part](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks/blob/main/Task%20I%20Quantum%20Computing%20Part.ipynb)
2. Task III
      - [Task IIIb Quantum neural network](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks/blob/main/Task%20IIIb%20Quantum%20neural%20network.ipynb)
      - [Task IIIc QCNN](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks/blob/main/Task%20IIIc%20QCNN.ipynb)
5. [Task_IV_Classical_Graph_Neural_Network_(GNN)_Part](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks/blob/main/Task_IV_Classical_Graph_Neural_Network_(GNN)_Part.ipynb)
6. [Task V Open Task Part](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks/blob/main/Task%20V%20Open%20Task%20Part.md)

- [Proposal Images.ipynb](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks/blob/main/Proposal%20Images.ipynb) explores the datasets to be used in the actual project on a high level. They have been described in the proposal.
- [model_checkpoints](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks/tree/main/model_checkpoints) contains the checkpoints for the particle net lite model. [particle_net_lite_history.json](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks/blob/main/particle_net_lite_history.json) contains the history for particle net lite model. These are generated during the Task IV.
- [qcnn_model_history_epoch=100.json](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks/blob/main/qcnn_model_history_epoch%3D100.json) and [qcnn_model_history_epoch=20.json](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks/blob/main/qcnn_model_history_epoch%3D20.json) contains the history for QCNN model generated during the Task IIIc QCNN.
- [tf_keras_model.py](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks/blob/main/tf_keras_model.py) is used during Task IV from the implementation of [Particle net](https://github.com/hqucms/ParticleNet).
- [variance_plot.png](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks/blob/main/variance_plot.png), [model.png](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks/blob/main/model.png) are images generated during the tasks.


I have not uploaded the datasets here as they are large in size. I link them here.
- For Task I and III, the [electron-photon dataset](https://github.com/ML4SCI/ML4SCI_GSoC/tree/main/QMLHEP/qcnn).
- For Task IV, the [Quark/Gluon jet classification dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3164691#.YigdGt9MHrB).
